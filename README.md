# E-commerce-App
An E-commerce App in React is a web application built using the React.js library that allows users to browse products, view details, add items to a cart, and complete purchases. It replicates the functionality of online shopping platforms like Amazon or Flipkart, focusing on an interactive, component-based user interface with responsive design and efficient state management.
